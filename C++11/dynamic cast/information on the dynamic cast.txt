A dynamic_cast to void∗ can be used to determine the address of the beginning of an object of polymorphic type. For example:
void g(Ival_box∗ pb, Date∗ pd)
    {
        void* pb2 = dynamic_cast<void*>(pb); // OK
        void* pd2 = dynamic_cast<void*>(pd); // error : Date not polymorphic
    }
The object representing a base class, such as Ival_box, in a derived class object is not necessarily the
first subobject in that object of the most derived class. So, pb does not necessarily hold the same
address as pb2.


When reference is used for the dynamic cast, if dynamic cast will failed then it will throw bad_cast exception, as referce must point to some object.
in case of pointer is is assumed that either it is pointing to something or not but in case of referce if it fails then "bad_casr" exception will be thrown by the code.
